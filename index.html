                Arsene: "Are you forsaking him to save yourself?" <br>

                Arsene: "Death awaits him if you do nothing." <br>

                Arsene: "Was your previous decision a mistake then?" <br>

                Arsene: "I am the pillager of twilight--'Arsene'!" <br>

                Ryuji: "What the...?" <br>

                Arsene: "I am the rebel's soul that resides within you." <br>

                Arsene: "If you so desire, I shall consider granting you the power to break through this crisis." <br>

                Shadow Kamoshida: "You'll learn the true strength of my men!" <br>

                Arsene: "Detest the enemies before you! Change that animosity into power... and unleash it!" <br>

                Arsene: "Swing your blade!" <br>

                Arsene: "This power of mine is yours!" <br>
